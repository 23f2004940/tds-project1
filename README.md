# TDS Virtual TA (Tools for Data Science - Jan/Sep 2025)

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based virtual assistant built for IITMâ€™s **Tools for Data Science** course.

It allows students to ask questions â€” with or without images â€” and returns precise, source-grounded answers based on:
- ðŸ“˜ Official course content (`tds.s-anand.net`)
- ðŸ’¬ Discourse forum discussions (Jan 1 â€“ Apr 15, 2025)

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Supports image-based questions.
- âœ… Uses OpenAI GPT-4o for captioning and answering
- âœ… Retrieval powered by OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` and cosine similarity
- âœ… FastAPI backend deployed on Render
- âœ… Responds with source links (Discourse post/topic or Course content)
